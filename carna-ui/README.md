# Carna frontend application
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/scepticulous/carna-ng.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/scepticulous/carna-ng)

This is the actual implementation of [www.carna.io](https://www.carna.io), since it is now
a single page application and the entire logic is implemented in the frontend.

# About
This project is mostly a learning project that can also be used as a reference because it covers most of the topics that an Elm programmer might need to touch when implementing a real world web application.
These concerns are:

* HTTP requests
* Tasks
* Encoding / Decoding JSON
* javascript startup input via `flags`
* Using JS libraries via `ports`
* Reading and writing local store
* Navigation / setting URLs
* Url parsing for navigation
* webpack configuration
* Unit tests
* Fuzz testing
* User interface with material UI (elm-mdl)
